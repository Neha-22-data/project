Flight Price Prediction Prject -

Overview :

The Flight Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts flight ticket prices based on various factors

Steps carried out in project -

1)Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw data for effective model training.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes trends and correlations in flight prices.

3)Model Training: Implements multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best predictive model.

4)Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using various metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.

5)Web Application (Optional): Deploys the model using a web interface for user interaction.
