Flight Price Prediction

Overview

The Flight Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts flight ticket prices based on various factors such as airline, departure time, arrival time, duration, number of stops, and date of booking.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw data for effective model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes trends and correlations in flight prices.

Model Training: Implements multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best predictive model.

Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using various metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.

Web Application (Optional): Deploys the model using a web interface for user interaction.
